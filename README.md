Greek Thesaurus for Android
===========================

This is a Greek port of the online Thesaurus client that was
originally built for OpenThesaurus.de.

In order to achieve this we had to fix the XML API in
OpenThesaurus.gr to return "clean" UTF-8 (without HTML
hex entities) among other things.

This is an early version, use at your own risk!
